# GlobalEDA Fiware

In this repository you can find the necessary files to run **Fiware** on **Docker**. All files can be found here except the volumes used during development. The `Main.postman_collection.json` file contains the Postman collection which can be used to create the entities and service group shown below and the file `Grafana_Dashboard.json` can be imported into Grafana. 

The data stored in FIWARE is randomized and generated by two dummy devices.
